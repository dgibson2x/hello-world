		<h2>What is a Low Carb or Keto Diet?</h2>
		
		<img src="realfood.jpg">
		<p>A low-carb diet means that you eat fewer carbohydrates and a higher proportion of fat. This can also be called a low-carb, high-fat diet (LCHF) or a keto diet.  For decades we’ve been told that fat is detrimental to our health. Meanwhile low-fat “diet” products, often full of sugar, have flooded supermarket shelves. This has most likely been a major mistake, that coincided with the start of the obesity epidemic.</p>
		<p>Studies now show that there’s no reason to fear natural fats. Fat is your friend (here’s why). On a low-carb diet, you can eat all the fat you need to feel satisfied and, instead, you minimize your intake of sugar and starches. Most people can eat delicious foods until they are satisfied – and still lose weight.</p>
		<p>How does it work? When you avoid sugar and starches, your blood sugar tends to stabilize, and the levels of the fat-storing hormone insulin drop. This increases fat burning and makes you feel more satiated, reducing food intake and causing weight loss.</p>

		<p>As a young ER doctor, Peter Attia felt contempt for a patient with diabetes. She was overweight, he thought, and thus responsible for the fact that she needed a foot amputation. But years later, Attia received an unpleasant medical surprise that led him to wonder: is our understanding of diabetes right? Could the precursors to diabetes cause obesity, and not the other way around? A look at how assumptions may be leading us to wage the wrong medical war.</p>
